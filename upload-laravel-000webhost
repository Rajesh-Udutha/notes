Follow the steps to upload laravel project to 000webhost

The question is quite old however others may find this answer useful. Basically what you have to do is to configure the App to work properly in the new environment.

1. Go to 000webhost cPanel > Settings > General > Reset website. You must make sure no other content is present in your site to prevent interference.

2. Archive your entire Laravel Project in ZIP format.

3. Upload the archive to 000webhost site to /public_html using File Manager.

4. Move all files/folders which are on the same level with package.json to /

5. Delete /public_html. You won't need it anymore.

6. Rename /public to /public_html

7. Go to /app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php at register() method and append the following code inside it:

    $this -> app -> bind('path.public', function() { return base_path('public_html'); });

8. Open /.env. Copy APP_KEY value without base64:

9. Go to /config/app.php, find 'key' and replace the line with the following code:

    'key' => env('APP_KEY', base64_decode('%YOUR_COPIED_APPKEY%'));

    If you have your project connected to a database, update the database credentials from /config/database.php. Lookup for mysql vector and update the database, username, password properly.

  ...And this should do the trick. If you have further questions, a tutorial has been written about the entire procedure here: https://www.000webhost.com/forum/t/deploy-laravel-project-into-000webhost-site/127323/
