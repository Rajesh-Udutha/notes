1. otp bypass
    we have been validating the otp through ajax, but in response we are getting 1 for failure and 0 for success.
    if the user entered the wrong otp, then response be 1 but using Burp scanner intercepting, when we change 1 to 0 in response, even the otp entered is wrong, the response 
    changing to 0 and user logins.
    
    remedy:
      encrypted the response value in controller in php
      and decrypter the response value in ajax success.
      so that in response through Burp Scanner, only encrypted data will be shown. It is not possible to decrypt and change the value
      
2. Directory listing
     When entering the images folder url in browser, it is displaying all the images names.
     
     remedy:
     
     connected to aws of server through putty
     go to apache2.conf 
     /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
     
     changed the following lines 
     
     <Directory /var/www>
     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
     AllowOverride None
     Require all granted
     </Directory>
     
     to

     Options FollowSymLinks
     AllowOverride None
     Require all granted
     </Directory>
