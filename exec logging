exec is command used to execute statement or file in php.
PHP will not wait until exec to be execute.
If we have to execute a file/statement in background in php, 
we can use exec command, this command will execute in background without interrupting php.
We can get the output from the exec command with following syntax

  exec('php _protected/yii '.$integrationConfig.'/run-client-integration  2>&1', $output);
  
  here print_r($output) will print all the echo's and result.
  it will also prints the steps/echo statements
