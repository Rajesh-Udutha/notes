Step 1. 
      For any new task, we will create a new branch in git with the task id
      let say, for task 4598 the branch in git is feature/TPS-4598.
      We will switch to that branch in local.

Step 2. 
      After completing the task, we will commit and push the code to task branch.
      Let say to feature/TPS-4598 branch.
      We will create a pull request from feature/TPS-4598 branch to development branch.
      
Step 3. 
      For created pull request, code review will be done and reviewer will approve the pull request or put comments.
      After approve, we will merge the code.
      The code will be merged from feature/TPS-4598 to development branch.
      The completed task code is moved to development branch.

Step 4:
      Now we will create another pull request from development branch to release/raptor_qa branch
      release/raptor_qa is branch for qa environment.
      The reviewer will approve and merge the pull request.
      Now the task data has been merged to release/raptor_qa branch.
      
Step 5:
      Now we have to connect to aws server through putty with ip address and ppk file.
      Command window will be opened.
      We have to login as user, here username is ec2-user.

Step 6: 
      Now we have to check the git branch in server, by using following command
      
      git branch
      
      press enter, it will show the current branch of aws server, and it should be release/raptor_qa otherwise we have to switch to release/raptor_qa branch.
      
Step 7:
      In release/raptor_qa branch, we have to move to project directory by following command
      
      cd raptor-qa/raptor/_protected
      Now we are in _protected folder.
      
      Now we have to take pull from release/raptor_qa branch to server by following command
      
      git pull
      
      Press enter, the server asks for password then enter the password and, a editor will be opened with all files list, click esc and :q enter, to exit from editor
      All the files will be merged from release/raptor_qa branch to aws server
      
      For any migrations, we have to apply by following command
      php yii migrate --migrationPath=@frontend/migrations
